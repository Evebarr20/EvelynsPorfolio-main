        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>With a passion for Computer Science as my driving force, I embarked on a transformative journey at Eastern Washington University, 
            where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            Over the course of my first three years at <span>Eastern Washington University</span>, I have been exposed to a diverse range of topics, 
            including various IDEs, high-level and low-level programming languages, data structures, algorithms, relational database systems, 
            software development principles, web application development, and data mining. 
            My knowledge expanded through hands-on experience with an array of tools, such as R, SQL, C, JavaScript, PHP, Java, HTML, CSS, and LaTeX.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated leadership qualities, a strong work ethic, responsibility, and reliability. 
            As I approach the next school year, I am eager to further hone my skills in the fields of Data Mining and cybersecurity. 
            My aspiration is to secure an internship opportunity that will provide me with invaluable real-life experience in the industry.
            I am committed to making a positive impact in the world of Computer Science and eager to take on new challenges 
            that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally.

            <h3>Simple Hero Map Game</h3>
            <p>During my Object-Oriented course, 
              I embarked on a captivating project - a map-based game where the heroic character embarks on a mission to rescue the farmers by defeating the menacing goblins. 
              The game was designed with an emphasis on Object-Oriented principles and programming techniques.
              At the heart of the game, the User class played a pivotal role as a singleton, effectively managing user input through intuitive mouse clicks. 
              This ensured a seamless and engaging gaming experience for the players.
              To further enhance the game's efficiency and scalability, the MapFactory, a robust factory class, was implemented. 
              Its primary function was to facilitate the creation of diverse and exciting maps, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement to each gaming session.
              This project not only provided an exciting opportunity to showcase my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented concepts, design patterns, and game development techniques.

            <h3>The Internet of Pets</h3>
            <p>Ever wondered what happened what might happen if you give your students complete freedom to create an Internet of Things system over the course of a semester? In the case of my team, we stuck Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons to our pets and monitored their movement around the house.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Pets would move around our home fitted with small estimote beacons fitted to their collars, beacons which would be continously emitting a BLE signal. This signal would be picked up by RaspberryPi receivers strategically placed around our house. The receivers would forward any detected signals to a cloud-based server. Using an app on an Android device, the user could connect to this server and locate their pet based on where it was last detected</p>

            <h3>A Home Energy Management System</h3>
            <p>What a great beast you see before you in the image to the left. An intimidating, majestic mass of electronics. Aye, she's a beauty. The combined effort of roughly 15 ICT Engineering students in a single semester ICT Design, run by Zenon Chaczko.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But it's on the inside that counts right? It is very much the case for this system, this machine.It was coined the name of the 'Integrated Home Energy Management System' or IHEMS. It is a system that encompasses the combined programmatic interfacing of energy production (solar panels), energy storage (batteries) and home automation technologies.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>My part in this project was taking care of the home automation side of the show. My team crafted our own Z-Wave  controller (Z-Wave being a home automation communications protocol). Our controller was a Raspberry Pi fitted with a Z-Wave communications module, called the "RaZberry". We would send RESTful commands to the the Pi, which would then relay them through the RaZberry. Our part of the system meant that we could remotely operate electrical appliances and monitor their energy consumption.</p>

            <h3>A Call to All Heroes</h3>
            <p>In one fateful semester in 2013, I studied Mobile Application Development and built my very first Android app. It was called 'A Call to All Heroes' and was physical fitness routine, veiled, adorned in a Fantasy fiction theme.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The idea was that, despite perhaps stereotype and widely held belief, fans of fantasy fiction and Roleplaying Games (RPGs) possessed the ideal attributes for pursuing physical development. They could consistently and repetitively follow routine, they were motivated through visible, tangible progress. It seemed that the world of physical fitness only needed to be translated to them in a common language</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Enter <b>A Call to All Heroes!</b> Users would choose a class, which would provide them with a routine directed to certain physical attributes; They might choose a Barbarian to develop strength (anaerobic), or a Rogue to develop stamina (aerobic). Routines were presented and unlocked in zones to be travesed by the user. A new zone would yeild greater rewards, but more challenging routines. I wanted to account for users of all types - each zone would have routines for user's with access to a gym, a pair of dumbbells, or nothing but their bare hands!</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The implementation is a definitely a little rough around the edges - that sure as hell ain't Google standard Android design practices. But the concept for the project is there, and shall be revisted in the future!</p>
