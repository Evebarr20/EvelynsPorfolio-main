        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>With a passion for Computer Science as my driving force, I embarked on a transformative journey at Eastern Washington University, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            Over the course of my first three years at <span>Eastern Washington University</span>, I have been exposed to a diverse range of topics, including various IDEs, high-level and low-level programming languages, data structures, algorithms, relational database systems, software development principles, web application development, and data mining. 
            My knowledge expanded through hands-on experience with an array of tools, such as R, SQL, C, JavaScript, PHP, Java, HTML, CSS, and LaTeX.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently demonstrated leadership qualities, a strong work ethic, responsibility, and reliability. 
            As I approach the next school year, I am eager to further hone my skills in the fields of Data Mining. 
            My aspiration is to secure an internship opportunity that will provide me with invaluable real-life experience in the industry.
            I am committed to making a positive impact in the world of Computer Science and eager to take on new challenges 
            that will allow me to grow both personally and professionally.

          <h3>K-Means Clustering Algorithm</h3>
          <p>The code analyzes control chart time series data from the "synthetic_control_data.txt" dataset, which contains 600 examples in an ASCII file format. 
            These examples belong to six distinct classes: Normal, Cyclic, Increasing trend, Decreasing trend, Upward shift, and Downward shift. 
            The code has two main tasks: Using Java, it implements the k-means clustering algorithm to group similar control charts into six clusters. 
            After clustering, it saves the examples from each cluster into separate .txt files, resulting in six files.
            It also employs R for clustering and visualization. 
            R is used to generate the same six clusters from the control chart data and visualize them, providing a comprehensive understanding of the data's structure and relationships.</p>

          <h3>Prediction of Titanic Survival - Kaggle Challenge (R Lang.)</h3>
          <p>The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a machine learning challenge hosted by Kaggle. 
            The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that can determine what kinds of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster based on passenger data such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. 
            Participants are required to implement a classification algorithm from scratch and create a program that can accurately predict the survival of Titanic passengers.</p>

          <p>In this project, we explored the "mushrooms.csv" dataset, performed data preprocessing, and built a decision tree model using R. 
            The decision tree provided insights into the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms based on different attributes. 
            The confusion matrix allowed us to evaluate the overall performance of the model, providing accuracy metrics to assess its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Our project, MadLads, is a web-based MadLibs game that combines education and fun. 
            Designed for kids and teens aged 6-15, the game aims to teach parts of speech in an enjoyable way. 
            Users can create silly stories by filling in the blanks with different parts of speech, learning about language flow and word meanings along the way. </p>

            <h3>Simple Hero Map Game</h3>
            <p>During my Object-Oriented course, 
              I embarked on a captivating project - a map-based game where the heroic character embarks on a mission to rescue the farmers by defeating the menacing goblins. 
              The game was designed with an emphasis on Object-Oriented principles and programming techniques.
              At the heart of the game, the User class played a pivotal role as a singleton, effectively managing user input through intuitive mouse clicks. 
              This ensured a seamless and engaging gaming experience for the players.
              To further enhance the game's efficiency and scalability, the MapFactory, a robust factory class, was implemented. 
              Its primary function was to facilitate the creation of diverse and exciting maps, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement to each gaming session.
              This project not only provided an exciting opportunity to showcase my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented concepts, design patterns, and game development techniques.

            <h3>Randomized Select Algorithm</h3>
            <p>This Java code implements the Randomized Select algorithm, a clever variation of QuickSelect, which efficiently finds the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array. 
                The program takes two command-line arguments: the name of a file containing integers and the index (k) of the element to find. 
                It reads the integers from the file into an array and then uses the Randomized Select algorithm to find the k-th smallest element. </p>

            <h3>Richest Algorithm</h3>
            <p>This Java code implements the "Richest" algorithm, which efficiently finds and maintains the 10,000 richest elements from a potentially large list of numbers. 
              It achieves this using a min-heap data structure, which allows for fast tracking and updating of the richest elements. 
              The program reads the first 10,000 numbers from an input file, sorts them using heap sort, and then iterates through the remaining numbers, keeping the 10,000 richest elements up to date in the min-heap.</p>

            <h3>Matrix Chain Multiplication Algorithm</h3>
            <p>This Java code implements the "Matrix Chain Multiplication" algorithm, which efficiently finds the most optimal way to multiply a sequence of matrices. 
              It takes matrix dimensions as input from a text file and then utilizes dynamic programming to determine the optimal order of multiplication that minimizes the total number of scalar multiplications. 
              The program builds a table of minimum scalar multiplications needed for multiplying sub-matrices and uses this information to print the optimal parenthesization of the matrix multiplication. </p>

            <p>This Java code implements the "Topological Sorting" algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS) on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
              Topological Sorting is a process that arranges the vertices of a DAG in a linear order such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering. 
              The program reads a directed acyclic graph from a text file, performs DFS to explore the graph, and then prints the topologically sorted order of vertices. </p>

              The program takes a text file that represents the graph as input and allows the user to specify the source vertex for which they want to compute the shortest paths.</p>
